# Learning GIT

> In a Nutshell

GIT is especially useful when conjoined with GitHub for obvious reasons.
The true beauty of GIT is being able to work on your projects with the convinience of a text editor, and not have to work on your files at the same time as your collegues.

Some applications, such as Google docs, enables you to share your work with others and allows them to edit your documents.
The issue with this is that multiple people can be trying to edit your docs at the same time, and there is no safgaurd in place for this circumstance.
The document will keep changing with any little edit someone makes without stopping. It can certainly be frustrating.

Using GIT, GitHub, and your command terminal, you are able to edit your projects at you leisure. When you are satisfied with your work, are you able to decide when to share it amongst your collegues.
It can make collaboration vastly more efficient.

> Getting to know GIT commands

To use GIT, you must have it installed. various tutorials on the web can help with this.
Although there are many commands that you can utilize, these here stand out as the most used.

Remember
You ***ALWAYS*** start a git command with "git"

+ git add
  + Any changed you make to you project files need to be added with this command
+ git commit -m "*type your description/reason here*"
  + Once added, you should add a description and/or reason that you're changing you file so as to keep track of your projects development. Then commit (submit) your changes
+ git push origin main
  + This command is sent once you want your work to be published on your GitHub website in order to collaborate with others, or simply to display your work.

These three commands are by far the most utilized in the program.
I try remembering them by the acornym ACP. Add, commit, push. It mostly works.
