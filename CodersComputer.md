### Linux and the Command Line

As a software beginner, Understanding Linux and utilizing the command prompt to explore files is quite daunting
There are a couple of commands I was able to grasp. The commands are mostly just shorthand versions of words
+ pwd "print working directory"
  + it's like looking at a folder and seeing all the contents of the folder you're currently in, but instead of seeing it visually, you see it as a list in text form
+ cd "change directory"
  + the equivalent of changing folders, but you need to type the folder/location you want to go to
+ ls "list"
  + lists the contents of the folder/directory you're currently in

There are symbols that you include with these commands 
***/***, ***-***, ***1***, ***~***

They indicate pathways to folders/directories but I'm still having trouble understanding them. I'll unpdate as I learn more.
