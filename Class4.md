> Wireframing

Wire framing is another way to say brainstorming, just with online tools and webpage developement.
If you're trying to develope a webpage using HTML, then wireframing is essential.
You can:

- Breakup your webpage into sections
- Decide where you want your navigation bar to go
- Pinpoint where you want to add images or videos
- COllaborate with others for the best product before putting pen to paper (so to speak)

Once you have your blueprints done, you can begin the coding process

> HTML basics

Coding in HTML can be tiresome... if you don't have the proper tools that is.
The Visual Studio Code program is incredibly helpful in this regard.
One thing to remember is to always begin your session with the HTML tag at the very beginning.
Thankfully, VSC is able to auto-fill much of what you're going to type out.
This is why you want to map it our prior, that is, wireframe it.
Once you know how your layout will be, you can code out where your Headers, Body, Main, Paragraphs, Images, and everything will go, and it is made easier thanks to VSC auto filing what you need.

It takes practice, yes, but if this novice can make sense of it after some study time, surely anyone else can as well.
