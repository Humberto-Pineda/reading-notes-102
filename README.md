> A Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset is accepting that I, and no one, always have the answers. There are things that I don't know, and things I can't do... yet.
But having this mindset means that I am capable of learning all that I need to, all that I want to, in order to fufill my goals. That doesn't mean everything will be easy or come easily, however. Sometimes, it takes a while to learn a new skill and become comfortable doing it. It's important to remember three steps to stay motivated in periods of frustration:

1. I can ask for help
2. Challenges help me grow
3. Nobody is great at something at the beginning
