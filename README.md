#### A little about me

I was born and grew up in Southern California. No I dont surf but yes, I love avocados. I currently reside near Seattle, Washington. I enjoy hiking the forests and mountains, as well as swim and paddleboard in the lakes. I have a dog who's a mixed breed, but I don't have a clue what those breeds are. His name is Noble and I swear he's a weird dog, deer, and little bear mixed into one.

I've been a flight attendant for the past 4 years now, and have been blessed to have seen several different countires and most of the states in the USA as well. I like to capture my adventures with my trusty camera always by my side, or in my pocket to be more precise. That is, my cellphone camera.

Using the skills I will learn in Code Fellows, I hope to develope my own side project website showcasing all the photographs that I've captured and will continue to capture throught the years. I'm am truly excited to find out what I can learn!
