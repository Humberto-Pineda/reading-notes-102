#### A little about me

I was born and grew up in Southern California. No I dont surf but yes, I love avocados. I currently reside near Seattle, Washington. I enjoy hiking the forests and mountains, as well as swim and paddleboard in the lakes. I have a dog who's a mixed breed, but I don't have a clue what those breeds are. His name is Noble and I swear he's a weird dog, deer, and little bear mixed into one.

I've been a flight attendant for the past 4 years now, and have been blessed to have seen several different countires and most of the states in the USA as well. I like to capture my adventures with my trusty camera always by my side, or in my pocket to be more precise. That is, my cellphone camera.

Using the skills I will learn in Code Fellows, I hope to develope my own side project website showcasing all the photographs that I've captured and will continue to capture throught the years. I'm am truly excited to find out what I can learn!

> A Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset is accepting that I, and no one, always have the answers. There are things that I don't know, and things I can't do... yet.
But having this mindset means that I am capable of learning all that I need to, all that I want to, in order to fufill my goals. That doesn't mean everything will be easy or come easily, however. Sometimes, it takes a while to learn and become comfortable. It's important to remember three steps to stay motivated in periods of frustration:

1. I can ask for help
2. Challenges help me grow
3. Nobody is great at something at the beginning
