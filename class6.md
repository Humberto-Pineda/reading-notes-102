# Javascript

> Making the internet fun

Javascript it what adds the zest to being on the internet.

If html is the bones of a website, and css is the beatification of the web pages, Javascript is what brings life to webpages.

Javascript allows you to interact with a website, play a game, input your name, buy products... basically everything you do on the web!

That being said, it's probably the most indepth language so far.

I was able to play with a few things javascript can do, and here are 3 things that stand out

- If, Else statments
  - These seem the most straight forward and easiest to understand. "If" something happens, then print this on screen. "Else", (otherwise), print this instead.
- Strings
  - Anything written in javascript that has '?' around them are considered a string. This includes what we percieve as numbers. 2+3=5 but if we add '2' instead of 2 it becomes '2'+3=23
  If we do the opposite 2+'3' it still becomes 2+'3'=23 One more example, 1+2+3=6 but '1'+2+3=15 and '1'+'2'+3=123 and 1+2+'3'=33
- Console
  - I feel like utilizing the console is most fun, because you get to have visitors to you page interact with what youve created. You can make a little quiz, ask for input, or make quick jokes with the user.

This simply touches the tip of the surface of the vast amount of things you can do with javascript.
